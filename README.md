# Hacker Rank Practice
### My code for Hacker Rank practice problems

### server.py file
This is the main file I update. Everyday I try and do one Hacker Rank problem within an hour and push it to this server.py file.
Here, are some examples of my code, using Gist:

1. Hurdle Race Problem [here](https://gist.github.com/paynesc1/79e7e1fcd0d25a3ec4a7b31c8295c13a)
2. Cat and Mouse Problem [here](https://gist.github.com/paynesc1/a5d013092db21d4399529a5ecad7d983)
