# Hacker Rank Practice
### My code for Hacker Rank practice problems

### server.py file
This is the main file I update. Everyday I try and do one Hacker Rank problem within an hour and push it to this server.py file.
Here, are some examples of my code, using Gist:

1. Hurdle Race Problem [here](https://gist.github.com/paynesc1/79e7e1fcd0d25a3ec4a7b31c8295c13a)
2. Cat and Mouse Problem [here](https://gist.github.com/paynesc1/a5d013092db21d4399529a5ecad7d983)
3. Breaking the Records Problem [here](https://gist.github.com/paynesc1/8c47e06b3e418f37af983e03026014df)
4. Bon Appetit Problem [here]('https://gist.github.com/paynesc1/01c8026bb32c5223c72635ae12db9cf6')

### practice.py file
This is a file I updated with many array algorithms. So this will be an array practice file.

1. Classic FizzBuzz Problem [here](https://gist.github.com/paynesc1/c298eb9bb3d6f1e851601020c494d115)
